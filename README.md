# Atlapetes Blancae
Atlapetes Blancae is an endangered bird species in the Antioquia region. Because of this, an application to recognize the bird in its environment using a phone's camera and a structured Machine Learning classification model was developed.

## How it works
Set up your application to your needs based on your camera and phone capabilities, and record a 10-second video of the bird. Then, wait for the app to analyze your video and return the results.
If your video has the bird on it, you will be able to share it via email with the researchers to further improve the recognizing model.

# Setup
Simply clone the project and open it with Android Studio Giraffe.
